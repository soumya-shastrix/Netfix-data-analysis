# Netfix-data-analysis
This project, titled Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization, is an intermediate-level data analytics initiative aimed at exploring the Netflix catalog from 2008 to 2021. Using tools such as Python, SQL, and Tableau, the project focuses on cleaning a dataset, analyzing trends, and creating visualizations. The data, spanning movies, TV shows, and original content, includes details like release dates, directors, countries, and genres. Key steps include handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, splitting columns, and populating missing rows. Exploratory analysis reveals insights into content distribution (movies vs. TV shows), popular genres, top directors, and global content availability. Additionally, trends in content additions over time, monthly and yearly releases, and country-specific insights are visualized. Advanced steps include using Tableau dashboards to enhance interactivity and Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud for graphical representation. This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling, paving the way for advanced machine learning tasks and business insights.
